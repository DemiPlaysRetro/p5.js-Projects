Obviously, dates.txt holds information about the javascript files in folders, the format is as so:

<#>. <NAME> <(Short description?)> | <DATE CREATED> | <DATE MODIFIED>

All files are subject to modification, changes in categorization, and deportation, so only use dates.txt to get file information.

Also, if programming seems bad in these projects, I don't care, most of these I make in my free time or at school as proofs of concept or just fun things to test out.

You need p5.js to play these, obviously, but they can still be used as research since I always try to keep math and logic as from-scratch as possible.

My p5.js account name is: DemiMakesStuff

I might document p5.js urls but idk
